    <h1>Big data vs. business intelligence</h1>
    <big>
        <p>
            The growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between "big data" and "business intelligence":[24]

            <ul>
                <li>Business intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things, detect trends, etc.</li>
                <li>Big data uses mathematical analysis, optimization, inductive statistics, and concepts from nonlinear system identification[25] to infer laws (regressions, nonlinear relationships, and causal effects) from large sets of data with low information density[26] to reveal relationships and dependencies, or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors.</li>
            </ul>

            Business Intelligence in simple terms is the collection of systems, software, and products, which can import large data streams and use them to generate meaningful information that point towards the specific use-case or scenario.
            <br><br>
            <b>Big data</b> is the most buzzing word in the business. Big Data is changing our day to day business life. Everybody thinks that Big Data is nothing but a massive amount of data. But in reality itâ€™s not a just massive amount of data, it is also about the structure of the data, processing the data with the purpose of delivering added value to the organization.
            <br><br>
            In the present era, the importance of data in business is very vital; because meaningful decisions can be made only with analyzing the data and these decisions will help business to grow further. Both the BI and Big data helps to analyze the data to get the insights and to view the relevant data.
            <br>
            Business intelligence and Big Data need to be synchronized, need to be used together. They both are not the same thing, but they share a lot of the same common goals. A lot of the distinctions between Business intelligence and Big Data tend to be arbitrary.
